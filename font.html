    <h2>As a summary of in Tuhfah.1, wearing one silver ring with or without<br/>
     stone on his pinky finger is sunna for a man. Also if it has a stone,<br/>
      it is sunna for it to face inwards towards his palm, out of emulation<br/>
      he Prophet, Allah bless and grant him peace, who did this. You can wear<br/>
       it on the right or left hand,<br/>
     but according to the Shafi’i School the wearing to right is best.<br/></h2>

     <h3>Muhammad[n 1] (Arabic: مُحَمَّد‎, pronounced [muħammad];[n 2] c. 570 CE – 8
      632 CE)[1] was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the 
      r of Islam.[2] According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent
    to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously
     by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.[2][3][4][5] He is
     wed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam,
     though some modern denominations diverge from this belief.[n 3]
      Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran
    as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic
      religious belief. He is referred to by many appellations, including
     Messenger of Allah, The Prophet Muhammad, Allah's Apostle, Last
      Prophet of Islam, and others; there are also many variant spellings
     of Muhammad, such as Mohamet, Mahamad, Muhamad, and many others.</h3>
